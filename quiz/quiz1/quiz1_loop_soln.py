# I have an agressive plan to take all the python courses on a website, within the month of March. 
# To make a plan, I need to loop through all the courses, starting March 1 (2022) which is a 
# Tuesday, and assuming I will spend 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, to finish them all in March.
# The schedule is printed out like this:
# 
# Mar 1 (Tue): Supervised Learning with scikit-learn : 4.0 hour
# Mar 1 (Tue): Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1) : 3.0 hour
# Mar 1 (Tue): Introduction to Python : 4.0 hour
# Mar 2 (Wed): Intermediate Python : 4.0 hour
# Mar 2 (Wed): Introduction to Data Science in Python : 4.0 hour
# Mar 3 (Thu): Data Manipulation with pandas : 4.0 hour
# Mar 3 (Thu): Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2) : 4.0 hour
# Mar 4 (Fri): Joining Data with pandas : 4.0 hour
# Mar 4 (Fri): Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib : 4.0 hour
# Mar 5 (Sat): Introduction to Importing Data in Python : 3.0 hour
# Mar 5 (Sat): Cleaning Data in Python : 4.0 hour
# Mar 6 (Sun): Introduction to Data Visualization with Seaborn : 4.0 hour
# Mar 6 (Sun): Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1) : 3.0 hour
# Mar 7 (Mon): Writing Efficient Python Code : 4.0 hour
# Mar 7 (Mon): Exploratory Data Analysis in Python : 4.0 hour
# ..........
# 
# As you can see, in the first day, I can complete a little more than 2 courses, 
# then start the third course "Introduction to Python". I will resume this third 
# course on day 2 with 3 hours of learning left (without printing out 
# that line again for March 2, but keep track of how many hours left for the 
# day to learn). So continue with the next courses, and stop after 1 hour 
# of "Introduction to Data Science in Python" on March 2, etc.
# 
# Print out the entire schedule for all the courses. It is an 
# agressive 30-day plan.
