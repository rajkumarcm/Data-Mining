# Our goal here is to learn
# * Basic HTML structure
# * Basic CSS structure and selector rules
# * Basic webpage inspection tools from browsers
# * Use of BeautifulSoup or other web scraping libraries, plus parsers

# We can use Python library "requests" to download the html 
# file (via a GET request to the web server). 
# In html terminology, the traditional way of posting forms are via 
# either the 'post' or 'get' methods. Collectively these are the standard 'requests'.
# As web design becomes more and more interactive, 'requests' are getting more sophisticated.
# For now, requests here are still the basic ones with 'get' and 'post'
import requests
# You can get a list of attributes and methods for the python requests object from w3school very handy
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_response.asp


#%%
myportfolio = ( 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'GOOG' )
url = 'https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MSFT' # we aim to loop thru our portfolio later when things are working
thispage = requests.get(url)
print(thispage)
# a response object, with status_code [200] means successful. It could be a blank page or error page, however...
print(thispage.status_code)
# a status code starting with a 2 generally indicates success, and a code starting with a 4 or a 5 indicates an error.
print("\nReady to continue.")

#%%
# To get the html body (and head) from the response object, we can use
print(thispage.content)
# The results typically should be like this
# b'<!DOCTYPE html>\n ...
# The starting 'b' character indicates it's in bytes, where as 
print("\nReady to continue.")

#%% 
# A cleaner way to extract the content is this:
print(thispage.text)
# will be in unicodes

# These are what you would see from "downloading" or "inspecting" a webpage in chrome/firefox/safari/etc.
# Try that.

print("\nReady to continue.")

#%%
# Next step is to use some kind of parsers to parse the HTML codes into standard tree-like or object-like structure (HTML DOM  Document-Object-Model)

# Useful to have basic HTML knowledge, the (XML) structure

# CSS (Cascade Style Sheet) is also an integral part of most HTML design these days.

# Most parsers can use CSS-style selectors, as well as Xpaths

#%%
# We will use the library beautifulSoup with the default parser lxml. 
# Another common alternative to beautifulSoup is the scrapy library.
# Need to install for the first time:
# %pip install bs4
# %pip3 install bs4
# One of the parser is lxml. We will use 'html5lib' mainly here. They are very similar and 
# you can't tell the difference most of the time. 
# If you need lxml, and your system does not have it, do: 
# %pip install lxml 
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

#%%
# soup = BeautifulSoup(thispage.content, 'lxml')
# soup = BeautifulSoup(thispage.content, 'html.parser')
soup = BeautifulSoup(thispage.content, 'html5lib')
# beautifulSoup needs the contents given by the requests.get(url) object, then parse it.
print("\nReady to continue.")

#%%
print(soup.prettify())
print("\nReady to continue.")

# #################### EXPLORATORY HERE ##################################
# What is the structure of soup?
soupkids = list(soup.children)
print(len(soupkids)) # length of 3 if html.parser is used, or 2 if lxml or html5.lib is used.
# soupkids = ['HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"', <html> <head> <title> ...
# print(soupkids)
print("\nReady to continue.")

# We do not need to pull the htmlbody separately. Beautiful soup will handle that for us. 
# Below are the steps.

#%%[markdown]
# First load up the page on chrome (or firefox)  
# <https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MSFT>  
# Let us try to pull the stock price value from the site  
# right click on what you what, and select "Inspect" to open the developer console. 
# With some understandings of html DOM (document-object-model, model is synonymous with data, ever since, forever)
# we can navigate the DOM object to find what we need.
# We can use Tag elements by its name, its ID, 
# or use CSS-style selector (usually my preference) 
# or use xpath.

#%%
# CSS selector
#   div#cnnBody > div.cnnBody_Left.wsodContent > div.mod-quoteinfo > div:nth-child(2) > table > tbody > tr > td.wsod_last > span

# Xpath
# //*[@id="cnnBody"]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[1]/span

# If you know what you want to find, use  the method .find() or .find_all()
foundlast = soup.find('td', class_='wsod_last') # by tag name and class values
print(foundlast, '\n')

#%%
print(foundlast.text) # almost got it

#%%
# Try
print(list(foundlast.children), '\n') # Here you are, the quote, in the first element of the list
print(list(foundlast.children)[0].text) # the stock quote 


#%%
# Also try to use CSS selectors
# Use dot . for className, use # for id
# cnnBody > div.cnnBody_Left.wsodContent > div.mod-quoteinfo > div:nth-child(2) > table > tbody > tr > td.wsod_last > span
# selectlast = soup.select('tr td.wsod_last span')  # CSS-style selector  # under <tr> any levels of descendants lower, find <td>
selectlast = soup.select('tr > td.wsod_last > span')  # CSS-style selector  # under <tr>, immediate children, find <td> 
# the select function will return a list of nodes. Could be an empty list.
selectlast[0].text
# Or if we know for sure there is only one, or just want the first one, we can do
# selectlast = soup.select_one('tr > td.wsod_last > span') # return a single node instead of a list
# selectlast.text


#%%
# myportfolio = ( 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'GOOG' )

# So with all these hard work, we can now streamline all these into a combined function call
