#
# Overall, the difference between pivot and pivot_table in pandas are these:  
#
# * pivot_table generalize pivot, can handle duplicate values for one pivoted index/column pair.
# * pivot_table allows aggreate functions with "aggfunc="
# * pivot_table allows multi-index (on rows)
# * pivot allows "values=" with numeric or string types. pivot_table only allow numeric (with str or categorical columns ignored)

# in this case, it is actually more convenient and sensible to index by the country. 
# The previous examples simply exaggerate the pivot tables are usually "WIDE"
dfgap_ptCountryGdpp = dfgap.pivot_table(index='country', columns=['continent','year'] , values=['pop','gdpPercap'])
dm.dfChk(dfgap_ptCountryGdpp)

# Again, you can do filtering and selections like this:
# dfgap_ptCountryGdpp['gdpPercap']['Oceania'][1967] # same as 
dfgap_ptCountryGdpp.gdpPercap.Africa[1967]
# OR 
dfgap_ptCountryGdpp[ ('gdpPercap','Africa',1967) ]  # Using a tuple for selecting multi-Index (in the columns)


#%%
# Stack: Opposite to pivot
dfgap_sptCountryGdpp = dfgap_ptCountryGdpp.stack()
dm.dfChk(dfgap_sptCountryGdpp)
dfgap_ptCountryGdpp.head()

#%% [markdown]
# # Stack ~ Melt
# Melt is similar to stack, resulting in a long dataframe
# melt however does not preserve the custom index colummns!!
dfgap_mpi2 = dfgap_pi2.melt()

dm.dfChk(dfgap_mpi2)

print("\nReady to continue.")

#%%
# Finally, unstack is like pivot/pivot_table, which will be opposite to Stack/Melt



#%% [markdown]
# Roughly speaking:  
# long format (melt/stack) is good for data analysis of the raw data
# wide format (pivot/unstack) is good for summary, aggregates, and presentation
