# Two paragraphs about yourself. In one of the paragraphs, give a hyperlink of a website 
# that you want us to see. Can be about yourself, or something you like.

###### My name is Rajkumar Conjeevaram Mohan, who graduated in Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London also happens to be a technology enthusiast. My coding journey began when I was in the 6th grade, and HTML was the first web development language I was exposed to. I slowly started studying C, and by now, I have already learnt and used Java, C, C++, Python, MATLAB, .Net, PHP, Prolog, Oracle. Also, I obtained a diploma in Computer Hardware when I was below 17 years old and love troubleshooting computers. Most of my summer holidays were spent in some institute learning some computer related work â€“ I have got my hands on Adobe Multimedia Flash 5 to create animations, and I truly take the pleasure in writing complex code that probably many do not even know about. One of the languages that I have always admired at, would be Prolog as I happened to have liked the syntax and it would be my understand that logic programming would be useful at some time for my research.
###### It would be my long-term goal to pursue doctoral research in Robotics, which is one of the reasons why I push myself hard in learning things that are relevant, though outside the University course syllabus. Though not an expert now, I have the confidence that I will reach the apex at some point. I believe my LinkedIn profile that can be accessed through https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajkumarcm/ can talk about the rest.

# to replace it with Intro to Coal mining. Do that in python here.

# Question 4: Before you go see your acadmic advisor, you are 
# asked to create a python dictionary of the classes you plan to take, 
# with the course number as key. Please do that. Don't forget that your advisor 
# probably doesn't like coal. And that coal mining class doesn't even have a

# Question 6: Using loops

# Use only basic loops
# Goal: print out the list of days (31) in Jan 2022 like this
