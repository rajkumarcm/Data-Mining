#
# Okay, I want to collect weather info for my family living at different zip codes. 
# Feel free to replace the zipcode list with your favorites. 
# 
# Ideally, I can put the codes on pythonanywhere.com,  
# so that it can be set as a cron job on a reliable server 
# instead of on my own laptop.  
# As we did in class, we can use weather.gov to get the weather info 
# for the different zip codes. But the way that website is designed, 
# we cannot encode the zip code into the url. So we used 
# selenium to automate. But we cannot install selenium on 
# pythonanywhere.com. That is using too much resources on the public server.
# 
# Good thing there are so many options out there. I found 
# [this site](url = 'https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/dc/20052') works okay.
# 
# Now, get the codes to work, with a list of 10 zip codes with the state abbreviation 
# ( so the list/tuple should looks like this: ('dc/20052' , 'ny/10001' , 'ca/90210' , ... ) ), 
# automatically pull the forecast temperature high and low for the day 
# at 6am at our Washington-DC time? 
# The stock portfolio example (WS_sample_Stock.py) in class is adaptable to 
# handle this task. 
# 
# Have the codes tested and working on your computer. If you are interested, you can 
# deploy it pythonanywhere.com. I can show you how. Deploying to pythonanywhere.com is 
# an optional exercise. Simply run your 
# codes on your computer for a few days, or 2-3 times a day to get 
# the temp info at different times to make sure it works. 
# # The csv file will eventually looks like this
# Date,dc/20052,ny/10001,ca/90210,nj/07069,va/22207,il/60007,tx/77001,az/85001,pa/19019,tx/78006
# 2022-03-03,53° | 34°,50° | 34°,--° | 53°,51° | 29°,53° | 34°,30° | 22°,74° | 56°,71° | 49°,53° | 32°,71° | 51°
# 2022-03-02,53° | 52°,73° | 39°,68° | --°,62° | 32°,48° | 31°,40° | 25°,69° | 52°,72° | 52°,65° | 37°,66° | 56°

# 
# Some of the temperatures might come up as --°, which is fine. Don't worry about that.
# That's all you need to submit, the working codes and a sample data csv file. 
#  
# Imagine you can do something similar to track your favorite sport team's statistics, or air ticket price, ...
# What get you excited?
# 
# Of course, whenever there is an API available, use that instead of webscraping. It's much more reliable.
